Delivery and Quality

Requirment understanding
Accurate Esimation
Code Quality
Unit/Browser/Device Compatibility Testing
Timely Delivery
All assigned features, modules or projects are owned end-to-end and delivered smoothly and as committed. 
Requirements are proactively understood from product; 
Reasonable aggressive plans are made, 
rigorous tracking is done, 
there are no surprises and all commitments are met;


Proactively and complete understanding of the requirments from product and UED to avoid rework and to minimize corner cases.
Perfect estimation of every task and project to make the delivery on of before time that also helps the dev team to do the right estimations of the projects.
Manage parallel projects for different teams and coordination with product and other teams to utilize maximum time and achieve timely completion of the task/projects.
As per the product requirement and urgency of projects, schedule the projects or JIRA tickets accordingly.
Planning and prioritization of work according to the sprint
Ensure best coding practices, device/bwowser compatibility and compatibility issues resolve before delivery.
Ensure complete Unit/Browser/Device compatibility testing while development to maintain the quality of code and ensure zero Browser/Device compatibility issues after delivery.
Ensure best quality code with almost zero ui issue.
Timely delivery of all the assigned projects and tasks.
